# Quantum-Enhanced-Anomaly-Detection-for-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project implements a quantum-enhanced machine learning system for credit card fraud detection, combining quantum circuit simulation using Qiskit with classical ML models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest to improve anomaly detection accuracy via quantum feature extraction.
